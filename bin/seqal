# Driver for the Seqal hadoop program.
# For documentation on the command line options run ./seqal --help

# Run the seqal Map-Reduce alignment application.

############################################################################
# Usage:  seqal <input> <output> <reference tar>  [ trim quality ]
############################################################################
#
#
# Input should be the output directory of the PairReadsQSeq (PRQ) application.
#
# All paths are HDFS paths, and may be relative to your HDFS home
# (/user/<your username>); trim quality is equivalent to the -q
# parameter of the bwa aln and bwa sampe applications.  It will be set
# to 0 by default.
#
# hadoop is expected to be either in $HADOOP_HOME/bin or in the PATH;
# if you use a non-standard Hadoop configuration directory, set
# HADOOP_CONF_DIR accordingly.
